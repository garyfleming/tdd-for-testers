# Possible TODOs.

* possible Cold open: a whole bunch of ways in which people miss the big picture and waste their time. Nero fiddling while Rome burned. Use as an analogy to doing testing when devs aren’t TDDing
* What is TDD. Refactoring. Relationship between coupling and quality.
* Why devs also don't tend to do TDD (tiny lift from other talk)
* Thread I started on TDD for testers: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1267142652992028674
* Mobbing/pairing as a way of helping to contribute to TDD
* "TDD does also inform quality. Code written in a TDD-style is higher quality than code written in other ways. Therefore, if testing is in part about risk mitigation, I’d suggest that a primary way testers could achieve that is by encouraging TDD. But they don’t. Why?"
* Research shows TDD drops bug count by 40-80% https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1267197527570382848
* Rob M. disagrees (and is correct): https://twitter.com/RobMeaney/status/1267206816057954306
* Alaine M on seeing how many mistakes TDD caught: https://twitter.com/miller_alaine/status/1267200428070100993
* Alaine M more thoughts on TDD: https://twitter.com/miller_alaine/status/1267209052989329409
* Rob M " primary area of interest is how we can pair with devs to help generate test ideas, how we can collaborate to add complementary test techniques etc." https://twitter.com/RobMeaney/status/1267184719097200640
* Another good bit of thread with Rob M "I'm happy to participate or pair on the tests but i'd find it tough to be the one driving the initiative seeing as I don't have the expertise to answer questions or overcome obstacles" https://twitter.com/RobMeaney/status/1267203583071657984
* BunnyLaDame thinks people might be concerned that it'll take too much time or take away from other work https://twitter.com/bunnyladame/status/1267152974532325376
* "TDD is hard and I have never seen a tester [helping]" https://twitter.com/joost_voskuil/status/1267185907137945602
* "Why would I change already up and running system?" --> you can't https://twitter.com/amratya01/status/1267372123884044289
* "I'd suggest learning tdd and practicing it. Then you can help others later" https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/1267453468161257472
* Jon Jagger:  The Equilibrium Law; how tests and code can "oppose each others proper function" https://twitter.com/JonJagger/status/1267191219765022721
* "Maybe speak to the role of prototyping in the process." -- Maybe something here about how it's exploratory in many senses https://twitter.com/j_c_fitz/status/1267231632366370818
* What does tdd mean for me the tester? Lots in this one. Explore https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-testing-planet-archive/lessons/what-does-tdd-mean-for-me-the-tester
* Richard B concludes that TDD isn't testing but does provide some great artefacts to support testing https://twitter.com/FriendlyTester/status/501665754069368833
