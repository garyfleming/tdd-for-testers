# Abstract

"Test-Driven Development is what the developers do, not us."
"No-one needs to do TDD: we test everything with automated tests anyway."
"TDD frightens me. I think the developers want to use it to replace me."

With all these things and more said, it's increasingly clear that there's Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt in the testing community about the role of TDD in modern development practices.

Let's get rid of that fear, and replace it with knowledge.

In this session, you'll learn more about what TDD is, why it's such a useful tool, and when/how to use it as a tester.


# Key Outcomes

* You'll learn what TDD is and it's history,
* You'll understand how useful a tool TDD is to testers,
* You'll learn how best to work with developers who want to use TDD.
